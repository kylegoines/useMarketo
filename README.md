Best of all worlds marketo form hook

- Allows for full styling of native forms, (no need to use marketo styled forms!)
- Callback rich enviroment
- Ajax submissions (no refresh on marketo.submit)
- Tracked changes with normalized event triggers for handling data updates and submit

Marketo hook that merged the best parts of https://paulie.dev/posts/2022/12/how-to-create-custom-marketo-forms-with-react/ hook and the progenitor of both of ours https://github.com/charliedieter/react-marketo-hook.

Offers onLoadedCallbacks, successCallbacks, ajax support (or not!), tracked values state object, universal onChangeHadler to update the dataValues, as well as submitTrigger to wrap the whole thing up!
